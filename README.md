# Personal Project 1 - Data preparation and Visualisation

## Description
Data relating to consumer purchasing details from a superstore was analysed. Using Python the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Using various methods within the Python Pandas library, data regarding the postal and product information from consumer orders was analysed.

The final data was visualised using Tableau, creating 2 dashboards relating to the postal and product analysis. 

Tableau workbook is available at https://public.tableau.com/views/PersonalProject1-FinalDashboards/Products?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

SQL queries were also written to replicate the queries performed during the analysis and are available as a supporting document.

Although conclusions are drawn from the data, this project is intended to explore the data rather than obtain correlations.

## Files
The files included are the main Python script, supporting SQL script, Tableau dashboards, initial data and final data.

All scripts, along with the Tableau file are available in the main branch. Input and output files are available in their respective branches.

## Informal Notes
In the analysis of this data, I tried to keep away from the typical "which state has the highest profit?" kind of questions and explore some of the less obvious questions. Some of the sub-category analysis would fall into that sort of analysis however.
