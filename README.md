# Personal Project 1 - Data preparation and Visualisation

## Description
Data relating to consumer purchasing details from a superstore was analysed. Using Python the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Using various methods within the Python Pandas library, data regarding the postal and product information from consumer orders was analysed.

The final data was visualised using Tableau, creating 2 dashboards relating to the postal and product analysis.

SQL queries were also written to replicate the queries performed during the analysis and are available as a supporting document.

Although conclusions are drawn from the data, this project is intended to explore the data rather than obtain correlations.

## Files
The files included are the main Python script, supporting SQL script, initial data and final data.

All scripts, along with the Tableau file are available in the main branch. Input and output files are available in their respective branches.

The Tableau workbook can't be uploaded directly to github, but is available throguh the following links:

Postal Dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/views/PersonalProject1-Postal/DeliveryTimes?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

These dashboards are intended to be viewed in full screen, and may look cluttered if viewed otherwise.

## Informal Notes
In the analysis of this data, I tried to keep away from the typical "which state has the highest profit?" kind of questions and explore some of the less obvious questions. Some of the sub-category analysis would fall into that sort of analysis however.
